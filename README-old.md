<h1> percolation 2d </h1>
<h2> Version 1.5 </h2>
The present work was carried out during the duration of my doctoral thesis.
It is a tool that accepts as input the geometry, surface fractions and properties of the components of a composite material and calculates the percolation probability as well as the thermal and electrical conductivities.
In this version, the mechanical properties of the composite are not calculated, but there is an ambition to do so in a later version
