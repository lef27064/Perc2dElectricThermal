<h1> percolation 2d </h1>
<h2> Version 2.0 </h2>
The present work was carried out during the duration of my doctoral thesis.
It is a tool that accepts as input the geometry, surface fractions and properties of the components of a composite material and calculates the percolation probability as well as the thermal and electrical conductivities.
In this version (2.0), the mechanical properties of the composite are also calculated. <br>
